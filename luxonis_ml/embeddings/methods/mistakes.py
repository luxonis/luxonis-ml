"""Mismatch Detection in Labelled Data.

This module provides functionalities to detect mismatches or potential mislabelling
in a dataset based on various strategies. This is crucial in supervised machine
learning tasks where the quality of labels significantly affects model performance.

Methods implemented
===================
    - Centroids: This method identifies mismatches by comparing the distance of data points
                 to the centroid of their own class against the distances to centroids of
                 other classes.
    - KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors): This approach leverages the idea that if the majority of data
                                 is correctly labelled, then mislabelled data will be corrected
                                 by its nearest neighbors.
    - [Note: DBSCAN was considered but not implemented due to underperformance.]

Usage
=====
    To use this module, import the desired methods and provide the embeddings and labels:

        >>> from mismatch_detection import find_mismatches_centroids, find_mismatches_knn
        >>> # Detect mismatches using centroids
        >>> mismatches, new_labels = find_mismatches_centroids(X_train, y_train)
        >>> # Detect mismatches using KNN
        >>> mismatches, new_labels = find_mismatches_knn(X_train, y_train)
