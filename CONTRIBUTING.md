## Pre-commit Hooks

We use a pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency:

1. Install pre-commit (see [pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com/#install)).
1. Clone the repository and run `pre-commit install` in the root directory.
1. The pre-commit hook will now run automatically on `git commit`.
   - If the hook fails, it will print an error message and abort the commit.
   - It will also modify the files in-place to fix any issues it can.

## Documentation

We use the [Epytext](https://epydoc.sourceforge.net/epytext.html) markup language for documentation.
To verify that your documentation is formatted correctly, follow these steps:

1. Download [`get-docs.py`](https://github.com/luxonis/python-api-analyzer-to-json/blob/main/gen-docs.py) script
1. Run `python3 get-docs.py luxonis_ml` in the root directory.
   - If the script runs successfully and produces `docs.json` file, your documentation is formatted correctly.
   - **NOTE:** If the script fails, it might not give the specific error message. In that case, you can run
     the script for each file individually until you find the one that is causing the error.

## Tests

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing.
The tests are located in the `tests` directory. You can run the tests locally with:

```bash
pytest tests --cov=luxonis_ml
```

This command will run all tests and print a coverage report. The coverage report
is only informational for now, but we may enforce a minimum coverage in the future.

## GitHub Actions

Our GitHub Actions workflow is run when a new PR is opened.
It first checks that the pre-commit hook passes and that the documentation builds successfully.
The tests are run only if the pre-commit hook and documentation build pass.
Successful tests are required for merging a PR.

1. Checks and tests are run automatically when you open a pull request.
1. For the tests to run, the [pre-commit](#pre-commit-hooks) hook must pass and
   the [documentation](#documentation) must be built successfully.
1. Review the GitHub Actions output if your PR fails.
1. Fix any issues to ensure that all checks and tests pass.

## Making and Reviewing Changes

1. Make changes in a new branch.
1. Test your changes locally.
1. Commit (pre-commit hook will run).
1. Push to your branch and create a pull request. Always request a review from:
